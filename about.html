                    <h3>Biblical Grounding</h3>
                    <p>In July 2018, God gave Founder Winston A. Tolbert a divine vision and revelation for the development of an unmatched, spirit-filled leadership generation that will inherit and lead Liberia into its promised status in the global community of nations.</p>
                    <p>This vision is grounded in Scripture, particularly in the biblical mandates found in Habakkuk 2:2-3 and Nehemiah 2:17-18, which call us to write the vision plainly and to rise up and build.</p>

                    <p><strong>Habakkuk 2:2-3</strong></p>
                    <p>"Write the Vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time; But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie; though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry."</p>

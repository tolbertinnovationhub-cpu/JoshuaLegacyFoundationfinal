                        <p><strong>The Beginning:</strong> Born to a street child, Kofi initially rejected his heritage, feeling ashamed of his background and status as an orphan.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Transformation:</strong> TJLF's Arts and Heritage program connected him with traditional Liberian drumming, dance, and cultural practices. He learned about his ancestors and African culture's richness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Today:</strong> At 17, Kofi is a trained percussionist and cultural ambassador leading youth workshops about heritage. He also excels in mathematics and received a scholarship for technical training.</p>
                        <div class="story-quote">"Learning about my culture saved me. It gave me identity, confidence, and purpose. Now I'm showing other youth that our heritage is not something to be ashamed of, but to celebrate."</div>

                        <p><strong>The Beginning:</strong> Grand Cape Mount County had suffered decades of conflict. Youth were without direction, schools lacked resources, and hope was fading.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Transformation:</strong> TJLF established a comprehensive community center with STEMACH learning spaces, healthcare facilities, and leadership training. Youth became partners in community restoration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Today:</strong> Over 2,000 youth have completed programs. Three micro-enterprises managed by graduates now operate successfully. School enrollment increased 40%, and youth see themselves as agents of positive change.</p>
                        <div class="story-quote">"Joshua Legacy Foundation didn't just help individual children; they transformed our entire community. We have hope again, and our youth are leading the way."</div>

                        <p><strong>Today:</strong> Samuel's business employs five youth from his neighborhood. He partners with TJLF to train other young entrepreneurs, inspiring the foundation to expand the program to all 15 counties.</p>
